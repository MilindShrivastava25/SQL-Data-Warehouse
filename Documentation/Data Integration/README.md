# Information
The Integration Model maps how data from CRM and ERP systems is related.

From CRM, we get sales transactions (crm_sales_details), customer information (crm_cust_info), and product details (crm_prd_info).

From ERP, we bring in product categories (erp_px_cat_g1v2), extra customer details like birthdate (erp_cust_az12), and customer locations (erp_loc_a101).

These connections ensure we have a complete view of customers and products, combining transactional, demographic, and categorical data from both systems.
