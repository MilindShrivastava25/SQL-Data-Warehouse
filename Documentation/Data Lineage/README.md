# Information
## The dataset comes from two systems, CRM and ERP.
  - In the Bronze layer the data is ingested as-is. 
  - In the Silver layer, these tables are then cleaned and standardized.
  - In the Gold layer, they are combined into business-ready models like fact_sales, dim_customers, and dim_products for reporting and analytics.
